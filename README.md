# Beecrowd Problem Solving (PHP)

This repository contains my accepted solutions to programming problems from **Beecrowd (formerly URI Online Judge)**, implemented using **PHP**.

The main goal of this repository is to practice competitive programming, strengthen logical thinking, and maintain a structured archive of solved problems.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Practice algorithmic problem solving using PHP
- Improve logic, accuracy, and efficiency
- Follow Beecrowd input/output standards strictly
- Maintain clean, readable, and judge-compatible code
- Track progress across different problem categories

---

## 🛠️ Language & Environment

- **Language:** PHP  
- **Compatibility:** PHP 7.x / PHP 8.x (Beecrowd default environment)
- **Execution:** CLI (STDIN / STDOUT)

All solutions avoid PHP features not supported by Beecrowd’s execution environment.

---

## ✍️ Coding Guidelines

- Clear and descriptive variable names
- Explicit control flow (loops and conditionals)
- No external libraries or frameworks
- Optimized for correctness and readability
- Output format strictly matches problem statements

---

## 📊 Covered Topics

- Basic input and output
- Conditional logic
- Loops and aggregations
- Mathematical computations
- Percentage and statistical calculations
- String manipulation
